This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java when iterating over arrays. The `Bug.java` file contains the erroneous code, while `BugSolution.java` provides the corrected version. The error occurs due to an incorrect loop condition, causing an attempt to access an index beyond the array's valid range, resulting in an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. The solution involves adjusting the loop condition to correctly iterate within the array bounds.
